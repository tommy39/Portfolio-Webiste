					<h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
					<li class="section-text">I started in the games industry as a freelancer in 2016 working on small
						projects such
						as ‘Gates of Hell’ and ‘Post: Scriptum’. I started work at Romero Games as a 3D artist
						in 2018 working on ‘Empire of Sin’ which released in 2020. I stopped working as a
						3D artist in 2020 as the role had become unfullfilling to me. Prior to this I had been
						programming in my free time and grew fond of the challenges it created. Shortly After
						leaving the role of a 3D Artist, I decided I would pursue a career as a games
						programmer. </li>

							working with multiple scenes at a single time in a project within unity both in the editor
							and in-game.
							<br></br>
							Game Levels are scriptable objects within unity that contain a set of scenes which are
							assigned to it. Game Levels can also contain dependencies to other game levels which means
							the level requires other levels to be loaded for it to
							work, the game will automatically handle the loading of these levels and their dependencies.
							In the Editor the user can load a game level with or without its dependencies.

						<li class="section-text project-key-features">
							<span class="project-key-features project-key-features-heading">Multi-Scene Creation:</span>
							You can create a Game Level which contains as many scenes as the user desires. The user
							can also add new scenes to the level in the future. They can remove certain scenes from a
							level
							or delete the level as a whole. The user can also duplicate a scene from a level to another
							level
							they can also duplicate a level to create a new level. The user can intergrate their own
							scenes
							created through the traditional unity means into create game levels too, or they can choose
							to decouple
							scenes from a game level to act as an independent unity scene.
						</li>
						<li class="section-text project-key-features">
							<span class="project-key-features project-key-features-heading">Dependencies:</span> Game
							Levels can be assigned dependencies which are a list of other game levels that the target
							level
							requires to be able to run correctly. The user can choose to load a scene with these
							dependencies in the editor
							or they can exclude them, but when running a level in game the client will automatically
							handle adding all
							level dependencies.
						</li>
						<li class="section-text project-key-features">
							<span class="project-key-features project-key-features-heading">Categories:</span> Game
							Levels can be assigned a category to act as a filter for the user. This is helpful for large
							teams which may be working with a large number of levels and instead of having to look
							through an
							extensive list they can reduce the size of the list by using a category filter.
